# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is My Portfolio, which includes a page about me and my interests, a contact page with my email address, a link to my GitHub profile, and a link to my LinkedIn profile, as will as a portfolio page listing my projects.  The list includes images that can link to the project pages by clicking them, as well as links to the codes on GitHub for a few of them.

The input boxes on the Contact page are still works in progress, thus so far the submit button does nothing for now.

The styling and formatting were accomplished using Bootstrap.
